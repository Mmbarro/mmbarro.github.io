            <h1>Welcome to Megan's Website!</h1>
            <p>For this assignment I decided to design a website that shows off a few of my favorite films, so that I can practice stylizing websites and uploading images!</p>
        </header>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div>The Batman</div>
            <div>Fantastic Mr. Fox</div>
            <div>House</div>
            <div>Brokeback Mountain</div>
        </div>
  
        <section class="film">
            <h2>The Batman</h2>
            <img src="The_Batman_Poster.webp" alt="The Batman Poster">
            <p>This was the movie that had me absolutely fall in love with film and cinema! It will always have a special place in my heart as one of my favorites!</p>

        <section class="film">
            <h2>Fantastic Mr. Fox</h2>
            <img src="Fantatstic_Mr_Fox_Poster.jpg" alt="Fantastic Mr. Fox Poster">
            <p>This is a classic film from my childhood and the first exposure to one of my favorite directors, Wes Anderson. I love the design of the characters and the stop motion animation!</p>

        <section class="film">
            <h2>House 1977</h2>
            <img src="House_Poster.jpg" alt="House Poster">
            <p>This film is a psychadellic fun trip that I absolutely love! The 1970's Japanese horror film isn't for everyone, but I adore it!</p>

            <h2>Brokeback Mountain</h2>
            <img src="Brokeback_Mountain_Poster.webp" alt="Brokeback Mountain Poster">
            <p>A heartbreaking favorite I always go back to. I love the perfomances and cinematography in this film, and how it visually communicates its narrative.</p>
